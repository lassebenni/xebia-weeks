# My Xebia Data Career in Weeks

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [Lasse](https://github.com/lassebenni/). This is an interactive map of my Xebia Data consulting career, where each week Iâ€™ve consulted is a little box. The box's border color represents where I was living/working, the fill color what project/activity I was doing. Tap a box to see more details about that week.

This visualization covers my journey since starting in October 2021 up to today (17-04-2025).

This project was inspired by [Gina Trapani](https://ginatrapani.org/)'s implementation of [Wait But Why's "Your Life in Weeks"](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html). Her original code can be found in the [life-in-weeks github repository](https://github.com/ginatrapani/life-in-weeks).

This version is statically-rendered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on Netlify.
